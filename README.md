# 🚀 TaskFlow - Multi-User Task Management System

A lightweight, self-hostable task collaboration tool for remote teams. Built as a mini-Trello alternative — real-time boards, drag-and-drop cards, and role-based permissions, without the bloat or cost of larger tools.

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

Remote teams lack a lightweight, self-hostable task collaboration tool. Most existing tools are either too bloated or too expensive for small teams. TaskFlow solves this with a simple, fast, self-hostable kanban board.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** — Register and log in via PocketBase (token-based auth)
- 📋 **Boards & Columns** — Boards contain To Do / In Progress / Done columns

- 📝 **Task Details** — Title, description, assignee, due date, and priority (Low / Medium / High)
- 💬 **Comments** — Discuss tasks directly on the card
- 🌐 **Real-time Sync** — PocketBase WebSocket subscriptions update both users' boards instantly, no refresh needed
- 👥 **Role-Based Access** — Admins can manage all cards; Members can only manage cards assigned to them
- 📊 **Dashboard** — Live stats: total tasks, completed tasks, completion rate
